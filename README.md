# End-to-End-ETL-and-Machine-Learning-Workflow-in-Azure-Databricks
This is an end-to-end ETL and machine learning pipeline built with Azure Databricks. This demonstrates how data could be loaded, preprocessed, model training with MLlib, evaluation, and finally, deployment. The trained model and predictions are persisted to Azure Blob Storage for later usage.
