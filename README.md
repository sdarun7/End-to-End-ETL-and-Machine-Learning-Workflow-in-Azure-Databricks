Machine Learning Model for Predicting Target Variable

This is a machine learning project in which a target variable will be predicted using linear regression. It may contain missing values, and imputation is done on that. The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).


Overview

This project aims at the prediction of a target variable, y, based on a number of given features, X. The missing values within the dataset are filled up with the mean value for every feature. After data pre-processing, the dataset was split into training and test datasets. A linear regression model is trained based on the training dataset, which is further tested with some performance metrics.

 Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing. Missing values are imputed through mean imputation.
    Modeling. A linear regression for predicting the target variable has been used.
    Evaluation. The model has been accessed using multiple metrics, viz., MAE, MSE, RMSE, R².

Data

The dataset is a few features and the target variable which we want to predict. We have missing values in the data set; we use imputation, and then it is ready for the model. Importing the libraries and loading data from a CSV file, however, depends on the specific dataset.

- Features: Independent variables used to predict the target.
- Target: The target variable to be predicted; for example, `Price`.

 Usage

In this project, the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, and the data is split into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is then trained using the training data, and predictions are made on the testing set. The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)

Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model is assessed by the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better performance.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Lower values are better.
- RMSE: The square root of MSE. It is a measure of the error size in the same unit as the target variable.
- R-squared (R²): It measures the quality of the model about the variance in the target variable. The closer it is to 1, the better the model.
